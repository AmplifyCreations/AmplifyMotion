# Amplify Motion

  Amplify Motion was the first Full-scene Motion Blur extension for Unity, released 
  back in 2012, and featured support for both Static and Dynamic objects, including 
  Skinned and Cloth Meshes. It was a big undertaking at a time when Unity was still 
  very far from having native Motion Vector support.

  This package was for sale on the Unity Asset Store between 2012 and 2019 with an
  average rating of 5 stars. It is now deprecated and we no longer support it, so we 
  are releasing it to open-source world under the MIT License.

  -test surfaces. It supports both stationary and moving objects. Handles translation 
  as well as rotation on camera and dynamic objects using per-pixel vectors.

# Quick Guide

  1) Apply "Image Effects/Amplify Motion" to your main camera
    
  2) Adjust "Quality Steps", "Motion Scale" and "Max Velocity" to fit your needs

  2b) When using overlay objects using secondary cameras (e.g. first-person shooter),
     simply add the camera to the list of "Overlay Cameras". That way both the primary,
     and secondary cameras will get proper motion blur, as expected.

  3) Enjoy the smooth cinematic feel
