# Amplify Motion

  Amplify Motion was the first Full-scene Motion Blur extension for Unity,
  released back in 2012, and featured support for both Static and Dynamic 
  objects, including Skinned and Cloth Meshes. It was a big undertaking at 
  a time when Unity was still very far from having native Motion Vectors.

  This package is now deprecated and we no longer support it, so we are
  releasing it to open-source world under the MIT License.
	
# Description

  Amplify Motion, previously known as Easyflow Motion Blur, is a complete and 
  fast full-scene vector motion blur effect that works with all opaque and 
  coverage/alpha-test surfaces. It supports both stationary and moving objects. 
  Handles translation as well as rotation on camera and dynamic objects using 
  per-pixel vectors.

# Quick Guide

  1) Apply "Image Effects/Amplify Motion" to your main camera
    
  2) Adjust "Quality Steps", "Motion Scale" and "Max Velocity" to fit your needs

  2b) When using overlay objects using secondary cameras (e.g. first-person shooter),
     simply add the camera to the list of "Overlay Cameras". That way both the primary,
     and secondary cameras will get proper motion blur, as expected.

  3) Enjoy the smooth cinematic feel
