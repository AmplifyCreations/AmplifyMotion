Quick Guide

  1) Apply "Image Effects/Amplify Motion" to your main camera
    
  2) Adjust "Quality Steps", "Motion Scale" and "Max Velocity" to fit your needs

  2b) When using overlay objects using secondary cameras (e.g. first-person shooter),
     simply add the camera to the list of "Overlay Cameras". That way both the primary,
     and secondary cameras will get proper motion blur, as expected.

  3) Enjoy the smooth cinematic feel
